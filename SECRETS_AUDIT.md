# SECRETS_AUDIT.md

> Audit date: June 15, 2026

## Summary

**No leaked production API keys** were found in tracked source files. Remaining issues are dev fallbacks and incomplete Vault path coverage.

## Findings

| Severity | Location | Issue | Resolution |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Medium | `src/lib/config/env.ts` | Dev `SESSION_SECRET` fallback | Fail-fast in `NODE_ENV=production` ✅ |
| Medium | `kairo/services/identity.py` | Dev encryption key fallback | Fail-fast with `KAIRO_REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=1` ✅ |
| Low | `deploy/monitoring/docker-compose.yml` | Grafana default `yieldswarm` | Set `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` from Vault before prod |
| Low | Test fixtures | Hardhat key in `verify-signature.test.ts` | Acceptable — test only |

## Vault path coverage

| Path | Seeded | Consumed by |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `yieldswarm/akash/runtime` | ✅ | Akash Vault Agent, agents |
| `yieldswarm/odysseus/runtime` | ✅ (added) | Odysseus deploy scripts |
| `yieldswarm/odysseus/deploy` | ✅ (added) | SDL render, GHCR |
| `yieldswarm/payments/runtime` | ✅ (added) | Next.js payments (manual inject) |
| `yieldswarm/kairo/runtime` | ✅ (added) | Kairo identity, Mapbox |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/unstoppable` | ✅ (added) | UD API |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/quicknode` | ✅ (added) | Multi-chain RPC |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/tenderly` | ✅ (added) | Contract simulation |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/sentry` | ✅ (added) | Error tracking |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/cloudflare` | ✅ (added) | CDN / Access |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/pinata` | ✅ (added) | IPFS pinning |
| `yieldswarm/integrations/livepeer` | ✅ (added) | Video streaming |
| `yieldswarm/rpc/infura`, `yieldswarm/rpc/ankr` | ✅ (added) | RPC fallback |
| `yieldswarm/agents/shards/<id>` | ⚠️ Policy only | Per-shard cron overrides |

## Incident — keys pasted in chat (June 2026)

Production API keys were pasted into an agent chat session (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, OpenRouter, QuickNode, Tenderly, Cloudflare, Pinata, Infura, Ankr, Notion, Kimiclaw, etc.). **Rotate all affected keys immediately** in each provider dashboard, then re-seed Vault. Do not paste secrets into chat, email, or git.

## Operator actions

1. Rotate any UD API key ever committed to git history
2. Run `SOURCE_ENV=.env vault/setup/05-seed-secrets.sh` on air-gapped workstation
3. Never commit `.env`, `deploy/config.env`, or `*.tfvars`
4. Enable `NETWORK_LOCKDOWN_MODE=true` in production Akash SDL

## Pre-merge grep (run before each release)

```bash
git grep -nE '(ghp_|sk_live_|sk_test_|ud_mcp_[a-f0-9]{20,})' -- ':!*.example' ':!SECRETS_AUDIT.md'
```

Expected: no matches.
